```bash
git clone https://github.com/ndless-nspire/Luna
cd Luna/
make
sudo make install
```

# Transfer

On Linux, `*.tns` files can be transferred to TI-Nspire device by: https://github.com/lights0123/n-link/releases

On Linux, these instructions must be followed too: https://lights0123.com/n-link/#linux
